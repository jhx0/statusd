About
======

statusd is a very simple way of collecting output from multiple 
commands via network.

Building
=========

Building statusd is as simple as running:

make

The statusd binary can be found in the build/ directory.

Configuration
==============

Create /etc/statusd and put your altered commands config file there, 
that's it. (A sample can be found in the examples directory)

Usage
======

Easy, just run the statusd executable and be sure to have setup the 
above mentioned commands config file in /etc/statusd.

You can use pretty much anything as a client that receives data. The
popular netcat utility does the job quite well, for example.

...the rest is history :^) Enjoy!
